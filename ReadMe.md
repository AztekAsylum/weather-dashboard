# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this ticket. I worked on creating a weather outlook for city of the users choice. It provides the user with the current and future condtions for a city of their choice and is saved to a search history incase a user wants to reconsider the previous search. It presenents the user with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. It allos the user to see future weather conditions for city of choice in their search. It presents a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representatoin of weather conditions, the temperatue, the wind speed, and the humidity. If a user wants to go back to a previous saved search histoy city, then again the user is presented with the current and futre conditoiins for that city.
